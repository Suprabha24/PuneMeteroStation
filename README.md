# PuneMeteroStation
A Java-based console application that simulates the Pune Metro network using a graph data structure. It allows users to enter source and destination stations, computes the shortest path using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and calculates the total fare based on distance slabs. The project includes a menu-driven interface with preloaded metro routes (Purple Line & Aqua Line) and demonstrates the use of custom heap implementation, priority queues, and object-oriented programming in Java.
